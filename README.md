# My First Published App on Google Play Store
I made a food decision app to show my potential for being a software engineer. Included in this repository are the majority of files I used to code the app.

I wanted to make an app and publish it, but my computer can't handle Android Studio effectively. I searched and found the Godot Game Engine. It was light weight enough to help me create this app, and then I went through the process getting it published and generated a privacy policy and it was a big achievement for me to start something like this and finish it.
